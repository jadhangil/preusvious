                Abingdon-on-Thames, known just as Abingdon between 1974 and 2012, is a
                historic market town and civil parish in the ceremonial county of
                Oxfordshire, England, on the River Thames. Historically the county

                    The area was occupied
                    from the early to middle Iron Age and the remains of a late Iron Age
                    and Roman defensive enclosure lies below the town centre. Abingdon
                    Abbey was founded around 676, giving its name to the emerging town.<br> In
                    the 13th and 14th centuries, Abingdon was an agricultural centre with
                    an extensive trade in wool, alongside weaving and the manufacture of
                    clothing. Charters for the holding of markets and fairs were granted
                    by various monarchs, from Edward I to George II.<br><br> The town survived the
                    dissolution of the abbey in 1538, and by the 18th and 19th centuries,
                    with the building of Abingdon Lock in 1790, and Wilts & Berks Canal in
                    1810, was a key link between major industrial centres such as Bristol,
                    London, Birmingham and the Black Country.

                In 1856 the Abingdon Railway
                opened, linking the town with the Great Western Railway at Radley. The
                Wilts & Berks Canal was abandoned in 1906 but a voluntary trust is now
                working to restore and re-open it. Abingdon railway station was closed
                to passengers in September 1963. The line remained open for goods
                until 1984, including serving the MG car factory, which operated from
                1929 to October 1980. <br>Abingdon's brewery, Morland, whose most famous
                ale, Old Speckled Hen, was named after an early MG car, was taken over
                and closed down by Greene King Brewery in 1999, with production moving
                to Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk. The site of the brewery has been
                redeveloped into housing. The rock band Radiohead formed in 1985 when
                studying at Abingdon School, a day and boarding independent secondary
                school.

                <br><br>
                The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 33,130.
                This is 2,504 more than in the 2001 Census total of 30,626, and
                represents just over 8% growth in the population.
